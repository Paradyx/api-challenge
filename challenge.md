# The Challenge
A customer bought a new application and want's us to retrieve usage data 
from it's internal API. Unfortunatley, we don't know how the application works. 
The customer only gave us the executable which exposes the usage data 
on `127.0.0.1:8000/usage/{pageNo}`.

We are only interested in the __full name__ and the __email address__ of those users 
which used the application from a __Linux client__ in __January 2020__.

Can you try to retrieve as many usages as possible? Please, prepare a short (maximum 15 minutes) 
presentation, which should include some details on:

- How the API works?
- What you tried? What worked and what didn't?
- Which technologies you used?

We do not expect from you to successfully retrieve all the data. Take 3-4 hours and get as much usages as you can. 
Have fun :)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
